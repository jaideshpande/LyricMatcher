To run for yourself, you'll need to create your own API Keys for MUSIX_MATH, OpenAI, Spotify Oauth, and Pinecone. Clone this repository and create a virtual python enviornment. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all dependencies, and then set the API Keys in your code or as environment variables using export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key'
